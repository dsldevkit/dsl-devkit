/**
 * This is a marker interface to be implemented by classes implementing one of {@link org.eclipse.xtext.resource.IResourceDescription},
 * {@link org.eclipse.xtext.resource.IEObjectDescription}, {@link org.eclipse.xtext.resource.IReferenceDescription}. The significance of it being that the
 * respective description can be {@link #detach() detached} at which point it no longer depend on any external objects and can thus be regarded as immutable by
 * clients and can be referenced without pulling in a lot of other hard referenced objects (e.g. non proxy EObject).
 * <p>
 * An exception to this is an {@link org.eclipse.xtext.resource.IResourceDescription} implementing this interface: All its
 * {@link org.eclipse.xtext.resource.IEObjectDescription} and {@link org.eclipse.xtext.resource.IReferenceDescription} objects must both be hard referenced and
 * must also all implement this interface.
 * <p>
 * The primary usage of this interface is that a client doesn't need to create an expensive copy (i.e. clone) the corresponding descriptor if it doesn't intend
 * to modify it.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *          type of description (one of IResourceDescription, IEObjectDescription, or IReferenceDescription)
 * @see com.avaloq.tools.ddk.xtext.builder.IDescriptionCopier
