 * A general filter for issues that are to be completely ignored in a stand-alone build. Filters apply to all resources
 * regardless of host language; the idea is that if some langauage's validator generates issues that shall be ignored
 * in the stand-alone build, one provides a filter to filter out these particular issues in all languages. if a filter
 * shall filter out certain issues only in certain types of resources, use the issue's uriToProblem to determine the
 * kind of resource and include that information in the decision.
