/**
 * A TraceSet is used to collect trace data in the form of {@link TraceEvent trace events}. The events are posted by <i>producers</i> using the
 * {@link #post(Object) post()} method or any of the convenience methods {@link #started(Class, Object...) started()}, {@link #ended(Class, Object...) ended()},
 * or {@link #trace(Class, Object...) trace()}. This will then dispatch the trace event to any <i>handlers</i> which have been registered for
 * {@link #registerSync(Object) synchronous} or {@link #registerAsync(Object) asynchronous} notification.
 * <p>
 * It is very important that the event producers post a "well-formed" stream of events, where every {@link TraceEvent.Trigger#STARTED STARTED} event is matched
 * by a corresponding {@link TraceEvent.Trigger#ENDED ENDED} event of the same type. This results in an implied hierarchical structure of events. It is
 * therefore recommended to post the events using a try-finally coding pattern. The TraceSet implementation is thread-safe and this "well-formedness" constraint
 * naturally applies to the individual thread only.
 * <p>
 * By default the TraceSet is {@link #disable() disabled} and will until explicitly {@link #enable() enabled} ignore all posted events. These events will thus
 * <em>not</em> be queued until the TraceSet is enabled.
