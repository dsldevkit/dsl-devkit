 * Derived objects associated with resource description.

 * Instances of this class are attached to resource descriptions or resource description delta.

 * <p>
 * Main purpose of the associations is to manage life cycle of the derived resources.
 * Associations enable generators to identify what derived objects (sources) should be dropped.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There can be many producers of derived objects, where generators executed by builder participants
 * are the most common kind. Objects produced by generators may be other sources, but could also be some
 * entities specific to the business application of a DSL (i.e. database objects). Derived objects
 * could also be valid Xtext resources visible to the builder. Therefore the framework in not trying
 * to interpret the information about the derived objects, but stores it grouped by the producer (generator id).

 * <p>
 * For simplicity we will refer to all producers of derived objects as to generators.
