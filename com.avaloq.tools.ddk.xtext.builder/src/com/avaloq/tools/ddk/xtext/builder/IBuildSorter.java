   * <p>
   * Input is the set of URIs of physically changed or new resources. The builder will try to write initial resource descriptions for these. If resources have
   * dependencies between themselves, it is beneficial to process them in an order determined by those dependencies. The builder is smart enough to dynamically
   * reorder resources, but such reordering occurs only if a needed reference cannot be resolved. If the uris can be sorted up front in some way that minimizes
   * such cases (i.e., sorting them such that all or most dependencies are honored, such that dependent resources come later), the build will run faster.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * This operation is supposed to make a best-effort attempt to sort the uris. For instance, in some environments with a known set of languages, it may be
   * possible to know that resources of a language A may never have cross-links to some other language B, but B may reference A. In that case, an implementation
   * might want to sort all type A resources before all type B resources. Moreover, the uris can be further grouped into several separate groups, for example to
   * allow for strict dependence/ordering between them (e.g. all sources of type are processed before sources of type B).
   * </p>
